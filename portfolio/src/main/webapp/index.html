      <p>Hi! My name is Claire Lee, I'm from Los Angeles, California, and I'm studying
          Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I like to spend
          time with friends, whether its out and about or online. Going to the beach, 
          movies, getting food, or even just driving around can bring a surprising amount of fun. 
          Otherwise, I'm online playing videogames with friends! Try looking for me online @cliaer (on almost anything). </p>
